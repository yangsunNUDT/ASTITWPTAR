# Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Tensor and Weighted Tensor Average Rank Approximation for Infrared Small Target Detection

This project implements an adaptive spatial-temporal tensor and weighted tensor average rank approximation method for infrared small target detection. It provides a robust and efficient solution for detecting small targets in complex infrared scenes.

## Features
- Adaptive spatial-temporal tensor decomposition.
- Weighted tensor average rank approximation for enhanced detection accuracy.
- Support for processing large-scale infrared images.
- Easy-to-use API for integration into other projects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yangsunNUDT/ASTITWPTAR.git
